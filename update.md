# Mehdi Harzallah  
**Software Engineer · Frontend · DevOps · Product Thinker**

I build systems, interfaces, and ideas.  
Some are clean. Some are messy.  
All of them try to solve real problems.

Scroll slowly. This is not a normal portfolio.

## 🧠 Hello (or whatever this is)

Hi. I’m Mehdi.

I’m a software engineer who:
- thinks in systems
- sketches before coding
- breaks things (intentionally)
- rebuilds them cleaner, faster, and cheaper

I work at the intersection of **frontend**, **DevOps**, and **product thinking**.  
I care about performance, developer experience, and not wasting human time.

Not everything here is good.  
But everything here is honest.
